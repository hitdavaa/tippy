Tippy is a simple application made for calculating the money you need to pay for tips of any percentage. The skeleton of the application is based on a video by freeCodeCamp.org on YouTube, other functions were added by me. The project includes a folder with the .apk file, so it can be downloaded and ran without needing an IDE.
